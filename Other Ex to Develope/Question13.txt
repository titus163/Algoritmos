Question 13
Consider the positive integer 50. Note that 50 = 25 + 25 = 5^2 + 5^2 and 50 = 1 + 49 = 1^2 + 7^2,
Thus 50 can be expressed as a sum of the two squares in two different ways.
Write a method whether or not a positive integer n can be expressed as a sum of two squares in
exactly two different ways.
The signature of the function is
int answerOne(int n)
