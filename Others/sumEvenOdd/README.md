## Sum Even Odd

Write a function that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns a value based on the sums of the even and odd numbers in the array. Let X = the sum of the odd numbers in the array and let Y = the sum of the even numbers. The function should return X - Y The signature of the function is: int f(int[] a)

Examples:
 
|if the input array is|Return|
|-|-|
|{1}|1|
|{1,2}|-1|
|{1,2,3}|2|
|{1,2,3,4}|-2|
|{3,3,4,4}|-2|
|{}|0|
