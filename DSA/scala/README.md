# Master the Coding Interview: Data Structures + Algorithms - Scala Edition

## Introduction

Solutions are written in Scala 2.13.8.

As Scala is a hybrid object-oriented and functional programming language, I have implemented all solutions as functionally as possible. This means that (for the most part) there won't be in-place mutations, no `null`s, and there will be lots of recursion.

If you see the `@tailrec` annotation above a function definition, this means it is recursive, but will essentially compile to an iterative loop (so no extra stack space is consumed).

## Requirements

- Java Development Kit version 8 or later
- [sbt](https://www.scala-sbt.org/)
