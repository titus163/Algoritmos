# Data Structures and Algorithms

## Welcome

Hello and welcome 

This project is designed to help beginner computer science students.
A place to learn and practice data structures and algorithms common to computer science. 
The goal is for you to be able to learn the ins and outs of these structures to the point where you can use them in your own projects and problems. 

Let's get learning!
