## Common Elements

Write a function to return an array containing all elements common to two given arrays containing distinct positive integers. You should not use any inbuilt methods. You are allowed to use any number of arrays.

The signature of the function is: int[] f(int[] first, int[] second)

Examples:
 
|if the input parameters are is|Return|
|-|-|
| {1,8,3,2},{4,2,6,1}            | {1,2}                                                        |
| {1,8,3,2,6},{2,6,1}            | {2,6,1}                                                      |
| {1,3,7,9},{7,1,9,3}            | {1,3,7,9}                                                    |
| {1,2}, {3,4}                   | {}                                                           |
| {}, {1,2,3}                    | {}                                                           |
| {1,2}, {}                      | {}                                                           |
| {1,2}, null                    | null                                                         |
| null, {}                       | null                                                         |
| null, null                     | null                                                         |

**#NOTE**: To ease debugging, Will return a string array.

**The solution is presented in C#.Net.

**#You can try your own solution in the programming language of your choice.**
