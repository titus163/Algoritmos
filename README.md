# Algorithms and Data Structures
## Practical Exercises

I wrote all the examples below as a result of tests I took while applying for higher education at an American university.

Part of the admissions process for a computer science degree requires knowledge and mastery of algorithms and data structures.

I documented and solved each exercise, trying to apply programming best practices and following the instructions for each exercise I was asked to solve.

**The solutions are presented in Python, Java, C/C++, C#, Go, Swift, Kotlin, TypeScript, Scala, Perl, Rust, PHP

**#You can try your own solution in the programming language of your choice.**
